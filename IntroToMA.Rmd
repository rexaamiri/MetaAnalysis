# What is a meta-analysis (MA)?

## Definition

> Meta-analysis can be understood as a form of survey research in which research reports, rather than people, are surveyed. [^1]

# R and RStudio

## R

R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. R software can be downloaded [here](https://www.r-project.org/). The most recent version of R is 4.1.1 (Kick Things) and has been released on 2021-08-10. However, some packages that I frequently use do not support the newest version of R. Facilitating this issue, I use version 3.6.3 on my system.

Nonetheless, you are able to install and use multiple version of R on your system and using RStudio you can switch back and forth to any version of R based on your needs.

To get help using R access their webpage [here](https://www.r-project.org/help.html).

## RStudio

RStudio's mission is to create free and open-source software for data science, scientific research, and technical communication. Inspired by innovators in science, education, government, and industry, RStudio develops free and open tools for R, and enterprise-ready professional products for teams who use both R and Python, to scale and share their work. RStudio Integrated development environment (IDE) can be downloaded [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). We are using RStudio for this workshop.
